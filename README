# 🖋️ Handwritten Character Recognition using CNN and Generative AI

## 📘 Overview
This project presents an advanced Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system designed to accurately detect and interpret handwritten text. The model integrates **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** for precise feature extraction and **Generative AI (GANs)** for intelligent data augmentation and contextual interpretation.  
The combination improves recognition accuracy, enhances dataset diversity, and enables the system to understand the semantic meaning behind handwritten characters — making it more powerful than traditional OCR systems.
